# $\lambda$ Lambda Functions 

I decided to write this small but useful note to further develop the idea of lambda functions which can be really handy.

## What is a Lambda Function? $\lambda$

When writing programs, sometimes we may encounter a situation where we need to write a small function that will run only once during the entire program's execution. For instance: we need to sum two real numbers x and y, we could do that by writing a small function that receives x and y and returns their sum like:

```py
def addition(x, y):
    """ Assumes x and y are two real numbers
        Returns their sum """
    return x + y
```

Then we would just need to call the function by it's name and input the two values for x and y like:

    addition(15, 20)

This is appropriate when we define a function that will be used more than once, but as stated, what if we want to use the function only once?

We can use Python's native ```lambda function``` also known as ```anonymous function```, which is defined as a **small anonymous function**. Why anonymous? Because it has no name to be called. A lambda function can have multiple inputs, but only one expression, that's why it's suited for writing small functions instead of the standard ```def```. It's syntax:

    lambda args : expression

Going back to the previous example, we could rewrite it simply as:

```py
addition = lambda x,y : x + y

print(addition(15,20))
```

So essentially, lambda functions are just small disposable functions. Python guidelines discourages programmers to assigning lambda functions directly to variables because it's hard to debug errors in the code if all functions have a generic and anonymous name.

## Why do we use Lambda Functions?

Lambda Functions are better used when we need to pass one function as an argument to another. For instance, we want to sort a list of strings where the strings are a mess: they're with different cases, spaces. Instead of writing a ```def``` function to treat this list and pass as a key argument on ```sorted()``` function, we can simply write a lambda function like:

```py
list1 =	['fox', 'Gnu', ' bee', 'CAT', 'EEL', 'ant', '  dog']

print(sorted(list1, key=lambda lst: lst.strip().casefold()))
```

In the above example, the lambda function is transient: it's born when we call the ```sorted()``` and it dies when sorted returns its result. For tiny functions that we use only once in the code, lambda functions help with memory usage.

We can also use lambda functions as anonymous functions inside other functions, for instance. A function receives an integer and returns the result multiplied by an unknown number:

```py
def func(n):
    """ Assumes n is a real,
        Returns n * a """
    return lambda a: a * n

# This will always double the number
doubler = func(2) 

# This will always triple the number
triple = func(3)

# Then we can call the functions with the values we want to double, triple...

print(f"Double: {doubler(3)}")
print(f"Triple: {triple(3)}")
```
